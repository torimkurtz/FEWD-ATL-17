# FEWD Week #8 Project: Forms

---


### Description


This week, you'll be practicing your form skills: you need to add a Relaxr form on a new page that is linked to from the home page. The form you build must include at least three different types of HTML form elements and some light CSS styling. We have given you an example of a form that renders well on the web and mobile devices, as well as an example, with starter code, of a registration form you could build for Relaxr.
